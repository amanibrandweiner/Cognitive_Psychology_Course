## A systematic review and meta-analysis of techniques to increase engagement
###### 2021 | Ashley Wu, Matthew A. Scult, Emily D. Barnes, Jessica A. Betancourt, Avital Falk and Faith M. Gunning
<br>

Blablablabla Einleitung. It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... <br> <br>

### Meta analysis at a glance
| | |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| | |
| **Focus of the study** | **Target group** |
| Research has shown that digital mental health apps can be efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Here, the relationship between engagement features of the app and its clinical efficacy was examined.| People with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Maybe also somehow therapists and/or the government as it can help reduce depression/anxiety, it can also have effects on the work of the therapists |
| **Average effect size** | **Additional remarks/results** |
| Smartphone apps were efficacious in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall small-to-medium effects (g = 0.2888, SE = 0.0999, z(15) = 2.89, p = 0.0119, Q(df = 14) = 41.93, p < 0.0001, I2 = 66.6%). Apps that employed a greater number of engagement features as compared to the control condition had larger effect sizes (β = 0.0450, SE = 0.0164, t(15) = 2.7344, p = 0.0161). | unexpected negative association between PSD features and engagement, as measured by completion rate (β = −0.0293, SE = 0.0121, t(17) = 02.4142, p = 0.0281) |

### Study example 1
###### 2021 | Christian A. Lukas, Bjoern Eskofier and Matthias Berking

#### What was done? <br>
The smarphone-based intervention MT-Phoenix ([mentalis Phoenix](https://www.mentalis-health.com/programme/)) was tested in a randomized controlled pilot trial with 77 individuals with elevated depression scores ([Patient Health Questionnaire-9](https://psydix.org/psychologische-testverfahren/phq-9/) scores ≥5). This was designed to test the hypothesis if the program would both be responsive to patients and provide initial evidence of a reduction in depressive symptoms. Participants were either instructed to train for 14 days with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist as a control condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured through analyzing the usage data. <br>

#### What were the main results? <br>
The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at post-assessment. Data from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention group used the smartphone-based intervention for 46% of all days (6.4/14) and reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did participants in the control condition (F1,74=19.34; p=.001), with a large effect size (d=1.02). Effects were sustained at a 3-month follow-up. <br>

#### Why is it relevant? <br>
A gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) with AAMT (approach-avoidance bias modification training) may foster patient engagement and effectively target depressive symptoms. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a phase 3 trial using clinical samples. Moreover, the intervention should be compared to active control conditions. <br>

#### Why is it a good example? <br>
The participant recruitment was performed trough internet announcements, which causes a more inhomogeneous sample than most university research, which often samples only undergraduates. Furthermore, a [professional patient questionnaire](https://psydix.org/psychologische-testverfahren/phq-9/) was used to filter people with high depression scores, which could lead to better results than just a self-made questionnaire about depressive symptoms. Also, not just a posttreatment assessment was conducted, but also a follow-up assessment, which leads to a higher credibility of the results.
