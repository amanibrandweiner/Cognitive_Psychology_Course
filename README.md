## A systematic review and meta-analysis of techniques to increase engagement
###### 2021 | Ashley Wu, Matthew A. Scult, Emily D. Barnes, Jessica A. Betancourt, Avital Falk and Faith M. Gunning
<br>

Especially in the current times, the number of people affected by [depressive](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric-disorders/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders) and [anxiety disorders](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric-disorders/anxiety-and-stressor-related-disorders/overview-of-anxiety-disorders) is as high as ever. Due to the rising of digitalization, a technical implementation of helpful therapeutic measures in apps and other various technologies is indispensable. Although there are already some apps on the market in this regard, they are rarely supported by the government, nor can they convince with a high level of effectiveness in treating the mental illnesses. Which characteristics and which basis is important for apps to achieve their hoped-for effects are investigated in this meta-analysis "Smartphone apps for depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of techniques to increase engagement" by Wu et al. (2021). <br> <br>

<br>

| **Meta analysis at a glance** |
| ----------- |
| Hard Facts:|
| **Focus of the study** |
| Research has shown that digital mental health apps can be efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Here, the relationship between engagement features of the app and its clinical efficacy was examined.|
| **Target group** |
| People with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Maybe also somehow therapists and/or the government as it can help reduce depression/anxiety, it can also have effects on the work of the therapists |
| **Relevant Stakeholders** |
| Mainly psychological researchers, psychological therapists, psychiatrists and software developers, but indirectly also the government. |
| **Average effect size** |
| Smartphone apps were efficacious in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall small-to-medium effects (g = 0.2888). Apps that employed a greater number of engagement features as compared to the control condition had larger effect sizes (β = 0.0450). | 
| **Additional remarks/results** |
| There was annexpected negative association between PSD features and engagement, as measured by completion rate (β = −0.0293). |

### Short-review of meta-analysis

#### Introduction
There are currently many apps on the market that deal with mental health issues. Many studies have already shown that the use of such apps can lead to a significant improvement in symptoms of [depression](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric-disorders/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders) and [anxiety](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric-disorders/anxiety-and-stressor-related-disorders/overview-of-anxiety-disorders). The problem with such studies is that they were mostly conducted under laboratory conditions. However, the extent to which the positive effects of such apps can be transferred to daily life, where users decide for themselves when and how much they use the app, is not clear, since user engagement (in particular., how and how much people interact with the app) is very low for such apps. However, user engagement is important because clinical outcomes in studies of [depression](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric-disorders/mood-disorders/depressive-disorders) or [anxiety](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric-disorders/anxiety-and-stressor-related-disorders/overview-of-anxiety-disorders) in which features were used to increase it were significantly better than without such features. <br>
There are different types of features that can be integrated into apps to increase user engagement, in this meta-analysis features from the field of persuasive system design and behavioral economics are examined in more detail and especially their impact on user engagement and clinical measures is looked at. But what exactly do the terms persuasive system design or behavioral economics mean, and what features do they refer to? <br>
<br>
*Persuasive system design (PSD):* <br>
PSD originally comes from the field of human-computer interaction and is a model that defines four dimensions through which apps can influence and thus also increase user engagement. Each of these dimensions includes several different methods that could be applied in an app. For better understanding, the four dimensions as well as some selected methods are presented here:
1. Primary task support, such as
	- Reduction (dividing complex behavior into small and simple tasks)
	- Self-monitoring (such as tracking behavior, performance, etc.) 
	- Personalization (of the app itself)
2. Dialogue support: 
	- Suggestion (from the app)
	- Reminders (for interventions)
	- Rewards (for a specific target behavior)
3. Social support: 
	- Social facilitation (showing the user, that other persons do the same)
	- Social learning (showing the user, how other persons perform with behavior)
	- Social comparison (of the target behavior)
4. Credibility: 
	- Surface credibility (app design)
	- Expertise (of the app)
	- Trustworthiness (informations used in the app)
The authors suggest that the application of PSD features to (mental) health apps could contribute to increased adherence, as this is already the case with internet-based apps. <br>
 <br>
 
*Behavioral economics:* <br>
Another way to increase user engagement is to apply techniques from the field of behavioral economics. Although these techniques, as the name suggests, come from the field of economics and are found there in the area of decision-making, the authors assume that they could also be used and have a positive effect in the area of (mental) health apps. Categories from which features can be derived are, for example, loss aversion (users are more interested in protecting themselves from losses than in making profits), fresh start effect (through temporary landmarks at which previous (mis)successes are set back to the beginning), pre-commitment pledge (definition of a goal in advance) and lottery (if people perform something specific they can win something). These techniques and features could be applied especially in the form of gamification (playful design and incorporation of playful features of applications that are not games, e.g. by awarding points, trophies or similar), as this is already known to have positive effects on user engagement. <br>
By applying techniques from PSD and behavioral economics, user engagement could be increased, which is why it is important to find out which and to what extent such features have a positive effect on mental health apps under real-life conditions. <br>


#### What is this study about?
As no study has yet looked at what features can increase user engagement in general or the relationship between such features and clinical outcomes (for example the symptom reduction), the authors of this paper systematically reviewed previous literature and also conducted a meta-analysis of smartphone apps to examine the impact of PSD and behavioral economics techniques on user engagement and clinical effectiveness. <br>

#### What are the results of the study?
The meta-analysis confirmed previous findings that mental health apps for depression and anxiety show good effects even without additional treatments. It was also confirmed that a greater number of features to increase user engagement also bring greater clinical effects. From these results it can be concluded that it is important to include such features in mental health apps. <br>

#### Quality of the meta-analysis - [MAGIC Criteria](https://github.com/amanibrandweiner/Meta_Analysis_Quality/blob/main/README.md)
- **Magnitude** <br>
Smartphone apps were effective in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall effects being low to moderate. Apps that had a greater number of engagement features compared to the control condition had a greater effect.

- **Articulation** <br>
The articulation was not precise and sometimes a little bit confusing. Some of the topics covered are jumped on without any transition or additional explanation and there are also parts where the authors express their opinion and explain it in detail, but then note in a short sentence that the results show exactly the opposite and that their opinion is not correct. The part containing the results is also not particularly clearly and uniformly formulated, since the quantity units and other measurement dimensions do not remain constant and thus only allow a non-intuitive comparability of the results.

- **Generality** <br>
In general, the research findings are generalizable because they examine different apps with different methods, subject matter, and features, and do not commit to a specific type of app
However, all apps were treated as a "standalone app", although this is not the case for some of the included papers (e.g. due to concomitant therapy, additional medication, ec.). This could affect the general result and thus the generalizability.

- **Interestingess** <br>
The results are definitely relevant, as due to the severe current shortage of psychologists, therapists and psychiatrists, alternative resources have to help out in order to improve the acute situation of people that are affected by symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results can help for further research and mobile application development in order to improve the apps and thereby improve the current situation of people needing and using those applications.

- **Credibility** <br>
The credibility of this article is difficult to assess. Admittedly, the assumptions and results are not far-fetched, seem conclusive and are reasonably coherent. However, the potentially problematic high heterogeneity is not discussed in detail, and the scientific basis was only roughly explained. In addition, motivations for certain methods are sometimes poorly explained and the discussion in the article is rather average. The topic of "gamification" is also not particularly uniformly assessed, as it overlaps with BE and PSD, but is not precisely classified.


#### Conclusion for research and relevant stakeholders
As a conclusion for psychological researchers, therapists, the government as well as the software developers it can be said that standalone mental health apps can help with depression and anxiety especially if the user engagement is increased by different features and methods. For the future, it would be beneficial if mental health apps apply a variety of features, for example from the field of persuasive system design, to keep user engagement high and thus achieve better clinical effects. This would ease the workload on therapists, allow the government to provide the necessary range of (financial) support, and give affected individuals more opportunities to improve their mental health. <br>
For people suffering from symptoms of depression and anxiety, it is also good to know that standalone mental health apps can have positive effects on symptom reduction, especially if they use some of the techniques described above, such as personalization, reduction or self-monitoring. When choosing apps to help with mental health problems, sufferers can therefore make sure that such features are integrated into the apps. <br>

### Study example 1
###### 2021 | Christian A. Lukas, Bjoern Eskofier and Matthias Berking

#### What was done? <br>
The smarphone-based intervention MT-Phoenix ([mentalis Phoenix](https://www.mentalis-health.com/programme/)) was tested in a randomized controlled pilot trial with 77 individuals with elevated depression scores ([Patient Health Questionnaire-9](https://psydix.org/psychologische-testverfahren/phq-9/) scores ≥5). This was designed to test the hypothesis if the program would both be responsive to patients and provide initial evidence of a reduction in depressive symptoms. Participants were either instructed to train for 14 days with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist as a control condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured through analyzing the usage data. <br>
<br>

#### What were the main results? <br>
The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at post-assessment. Data from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention group used the smartphone-based intervention for 46% of all days (6.4/14) and reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did participants in the control condition, with a large effect size. Effects were sustained at a 3-month follow-up. <br>

#### Why is it relevant? <br>
A gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) with AAMT (approach-avoidance bias modification training) may foster patient engagement and effectively target depressive symptoms. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a phase 3 trial using clinical samples. Moreover, the intervention should be compared to active control conditions. <br>

#### Why is it a good example? <br>
The participant recruitment was performed trough internet announcements, which causes a more inhomogeneous sample than most university research, which often samples only undergraduates. Furthermore, a [professional patient questionnaire](https://psydix.org/psychologische-testverfahren/phq-9/) was used to filter people with high depression scores, which could lead to better results than just a self-made questionnaire about depressive symptoms. Also, not just a posttreatment assessment was conducted, but also a follow-up assessment, which leads to a higher credibility of the results.

### Study example 2: 
###### 2019 | Christine Moberg, Andrea Niles and Dale Beermann

#### What was done? <br>
500 subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups, either waitlist control or Pacifica use, after successfully passing pre-screening and providing informed consent. All subjects had to answer several questionnaires before (pre intervention) and after 4 weeks, at the end of the intervention (post intervention). Before the intervention, demographic variables and clinical features (e.g. age, education, currently taking psychiatric medication) were asked and both before and after the intervention, questionnaires on anxiety (DASS-21, GAD-7), depression (DASS-21, PHQ-8), anxiety (DASS-21) and self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale) had to be completed. The Pacifica group also had. Individuals from the Pacifica group were also required to complete the questionnaires 2 months after completing the intervention. 
During the 4 week intervention, the participants were able to completely decide for themselves how, when, and how much they wanted to use the app. In the app, people could choose from various activities such as mood or health tracking, meditation, journaling their thoughts and challenging themselves to reach goals. <br>
<br>

#### What were the main results? <br>
This study led to exciting results, showing that after 4 weeks there was a significant reduction in symptoms in the people who used Pacifica compared to the waitlist control. These positive results also showed no changes 2 months after the intervention. 
No correlation was found between the number of app logins and symptom improvement.
However, there was a delayed positive effect of symptom reduction in stress and anxiety in those who used more thought records. This means that although there was a smaller reduction in stress and anxiety symptoms between pre- and post-intervention, there were greater effects between post and 2 months later and thus a significant improvement was seen.
In terms of demographic variables and clinical features, there were no moderating effects on effectiveness.
However, it was interesting to note that there was a moderating effect on stress and anxiety when psychiatric medication was taken at prescreening. Thus, there were greater effects on stress and anxiety in individuals who were not taking medication.
 <br>

#### Why is it relevant? <br>
This study shows that the use of standalone smartphone apps can lead to an improvement in symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, and an increase in self-efficacy. These findings are especially important in today's world, where many people are under stress and also some struggle with mild to moderate anxiety or depression, as it provides people with self-management and self-help tools who may not otherwise have access to therapy or other help. <br>

#### Why is it a good example? <br>
For me, this study is a good example because they made comprehensible steps and also explained why they decided to do it and that the introduction explained in general terms the importance and relevance of such interventions. I also liked that the app was described in detail, because you understood what it was all about. The aspects described and the fact that all the important points were addressed in the discussion make this study a good example in my opinion. <br>
